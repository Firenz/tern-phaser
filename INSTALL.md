#Installation

This document attempts to address the setup of [tern-phaser](README.md) with
specific editors.

## Prerequisites

Basically any installation requires a recent version of Node and npm. For Linux
users, [nvm][nvm] is a good way to get both (apt repos often have hideously old
Node versions).

## Emacs

Follow [the Tern instructions for Emacs installation][emacs-install]. Wherever
you run `npm install` (step 2), also run `npm install tern-phaser`.

## Vim

Follow the [tern_for_vim][tern_for_vim] installation instructions. When you run
`npm install` in `bundle/tern-for-vim`, also run `npm install tern-phaser`.

## Sublime Text

If you are using Marijn Haverbeke's own [tern_for_sublime][tern_for_sublime],
then you can run `npm install tern-phaser` in the `tern_for_sublime` directory,
where you ran `npm install`.

If you know how to install tern-phaser with the alternative
[sublime-tern][sublime-tern-alt], let me know!

## Bracket

TODO, please help me to explain how to configure bracket for custom tern plugin like tern-phaser.

## Gedit

If you are using [tern_for_gedit][tern_for_gedit], you need to install
tern-phaser globally (in addition to installing Tern globally as per the
tern_for_gedit README): `npm install -g tern-phaser`

## Eclipse

To use tern-phaser in Eclipse, follow [these
instructions][eclipse-tern-phaser] for setting up tern-phaser with
[tern.java][tern-java].
